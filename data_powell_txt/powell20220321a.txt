March 21, 2022   
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.  
Let me first pause to recognize the millions who are suffering the tragic 
consequences of Russia’s inva sion of Ukraine .  
At the Federal Reserve, our monetary policy is guided by the dual mandate  to 
promote maximum e mployment and stable prices .  From th at standpoint , the current 
picture is plain to see:  The labor market  is very strong, and inflation is much too high.  
My colleagues and I are ac utely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, 
especially o n those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and 
transportation.  There is an obvious need to move expedit iously to  return the stance of 
monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if  that 
is what is required to restore price stability.  We are committed to restoring price stability 
while preserving a strong labor market.  
At our meeting that  concluded last week, we took several steps in pursuit of these 
goals:  We raised our policy in terest rate for the first time since the start of the pandemic 
and said  that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate  to reach our 
objectives.  We also said  that we expect to  begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at 
a coming mee ting.  In my press conference, I noted that  action  could come as soon as our 
next meeting in May , though that is not a decision that we  have made.   These actions, 
along with the adjustments we have made since last fall, represent a substantial firming in 
the stance of policy with the intention of restoring price stability.  In my comments today, I will first discuss the economic conditions that warran t these actions and then address th e 
path ahead for monetary policy.   - 2 - 
 
The L abor Market I s Very  Strong and Extremely  Tight 
To begin with employment, in the last few years of the historically long expansion 
that ended with the arrival of the pandemic, we saw the remarkable benefits of an 
extended period of strong labor market conditions.  We seek to foster another long 
expansion in order to realize those benefits again.   
The labor market has substantial momentum.  Employment growth powered 
through the  difficul t Omicron wave, adding 1.75 million jobs over the past three months.  
The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent,  near historic al lows, and ha s reached 
this level much faster than anticipated by most forecasters (figure 1) .  While disparities in 
emplo yment remain, j ob growth has been widespread across racial, ethnic, and 
demographic  groups .  
By many measures, the labor market is extremely tight , significantly tighter than 
the very strong job market  just before the pandemic .  There are far  more job openings  
going unfilled  today than before  the pandemic , despite today’s  unemployment rate being 
higher.  I ndeed, there  are a record 1.7 posted job openings for each person who is looking 
for wor k.  R ecord numbers of people are quitting jobs each month, typically to take 
another job with higher pay.  And nominal wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades,  
with the gains strongest for those at the lower end of the wage distribution  and among 
production and nonsupervisory workers  (figure 2 ).   
It is worth considering why the  labor market is so tight,  given that the 
unemployment rate  is actually higher than it was before the pandemic .  One explanation 
is that the natural rate of unemployment may be  temporarily elevated, so wage pressure is 
greater  for a ny given level of unemployment.  The sheer volume of hiring may have  - 3 - 
 
taxed the capacity of the market to bring workers and jobs together.  The Delta and 
Omicron variants complicated hiring, and the strong financial position of households may 
have allowed some to be more selective in their job search.   Over time, we might expect 
these factors to fade, reducing pressure in the job market.  
A second source of l abor market tightness is  that the  labor force participation rate 
dropped sharply in the pandemic and has only partly recovered.  As  a result, the labor 
force remains below its pre -pandemic trend (figure  3).  Total demand for labor , measured 
by total employ ment plus posted job openings, has  substantially recovered  and far 
exceed s the size of the workforce .   
About half of th e shortfall in labor force participation is  attributable to retirements 
during the pandemic.1  History suggests that most of those reti rees are unlikely to reenter 
the workforce .  But some nonparticipation is due to factors  that may fade with time,  such 
as caregiving needs and fear of cont racting COVID- 19.  W ith prime -aged participation 
still well below its pre -pandemic level , there is ro om for further progress .  A more 
complete rebound is , however, likely to take some time .  Increases in l abor force 
participation  often  substantially lag declines in unemployment .   
Overall, the labor market is strong but showing a clear imbalance of supply and 
demand.  Our monetary policy tools cannot help with labor supply in the near term , but in 
a long expansion, the factors holding back supply wi ll likely ease .  In the meantime, we 
aim to use our tools to moderate demand growth, thereby facilitating continued, 
sustainable increases in employment and wages.

The I nflation O utlook Has Deteriorated S ignificantly  
Turning to price stability, the inflation outlook had deteriorated sig nificantly this 
year even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.    
The rise in i nflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters 
generally  expected.  For example, at the time of our June 2021 meeting, every Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC)  participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 
percent .  Inflation came in at 5.5 percent.2  
For a time, moderate inflation forecast s looked plaus ible—the one -month 
headline and core inflation rate s declined steadily from April  through September .  But 
inflation moved up sharply in the fall, and , just since our December meeting , the median 
FOMC projection for year -end 2022 jumped from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent.  
Why have forecasts been so far off?  In my view, an important part of the 
explanation is that forecasters widely underestimat ed the severity and persistence of 
supply- side frictions , which, when combined with strong demand, especia lly for durable 
goods, produced surprisingly high inflation.    
The pandemic  and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused 
a serious upheaval in many parts  of the economy, snarling supply chains, constraining 
labor supply, and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in s ervices 
demand.  The combination of the surge in goods demand with  supply chain bottlenecks 
 
2 This is headline personal consumption expenditures inflation on a Q4/Q4 basis.  The Survey of 
Professional Forecasters statistic is a count by the authors using the second quarter 2021 survey.  The data 
are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s website at 
https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys -and-data/real -time-data-research/survey -of-professional -
forecasters .  - 5 - 
 
led to sharply rising  goods prices (figure 4).  The most notable example here is motor 
vehicles.  Prices soared  across the vehicles sector as b ooming demand was met by a sharp 
decline in global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer 
chips .  Production remains below pre -pandemic levels, and an expected sharp decline in 
prices has been repeated ly postponed.    
Many  forecasters, including FOMC participants , had been expecting inflation to 
cool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely  available.
3  Expectations were that the supply- side damage 
would begin to heal.  Schools would reopen—freeing parents to return to work—and labor supply would begin bouncing back, kinks in supply chains would begin resolving, 
and consumption would start rotating back to services, all of which could reduce price pressures.  While schools are open,  none of the  other expectations has  been fully met .  
Part of the reason may be that , contrary to expectations, COVID has not gone away with 
the arrival of vaccines .   In fact, we are now headed once again into more COVID- related 
supply disruptions from China.  It continues to seem likely that hoped- for supply- side 
healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but  the 
timing and scope of that r elief are highly uncertain.  In the meantime,  as we set policy , 
we will be looking to actual  progress on these issues and not assuming  significant near -
term supply -side relief.    
The P olicy Response 
As the magnitude  and persistence of the increase in inflation  became increasingly 
clear  over the second half of last year , and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond

expectations , the FOMC pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy.  
In June, the median FOMC parti cipant projected that the federal funds rate would remain 
at its effective lower bound through the end of 2022, and as the news came in, the 
projected policy paths shifted higher  (figure 5) .  The median projection that accompanied 
last week’s 25 basis poin t rate increase shows the federal funds rate at 1.9 percent by the 
end of this year and rising above its estimated longer -run normal value in  2023.  The 
latest FOMC statement  also indicates that the Committee expects to begin reducing the 
size of our balan ce sheet at a coming meeting.  I believe that these policy actions and 
those to come will help bring inflation down near 2 percent over the next 3 years.  
As always, our  policy projections are not a C ommittee decision or fixed plan.  
Instead, they are a su mmary of what the FOMC participants see as the most likely case 
going forward.  T he events of the past four  week s remind us  that, in tumultuous times , 
what seems like the most likely scenario may change quite quickly :  Each S ummary of 
Economic Projections  reflects  a point in time and can become outdated quickly at times 
like these, when events are developing rapidly.    
Thus, my main message today is  that, as the outlook evolves, we will adjust 
policy as needed in orde r to e nsure a return to price stability with a strong job market .  
Let me now turn  to three questions about the likely evolution of policy.  
How will fallout from the invasion of Ukraine aff ect the economy and monetary 
policy?  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may  have significant effects on the world economy 
and the U.S. economy.  The  magnitude and persistence of these effects remain highly 
uncertain and depend on events yet to come .    - 7 - 
 
Russia is one of the world’s largest producers of commodities , and Ukraine is a 
key producer of several commodities  as well , including wheat and neon, which is used in 
the production of computer chips .  There is no recent experience with significant market 
disrupti on across such a broad range of commodities.  In addition to the direct effects 
from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events are likely to 
restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would crea te 
spillovers to the U.S. economy.   
We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970s —
not a happy story.  Fortunately, the United S tates is now much better situated to weather 
oil price shocks.4  We are now the world’s largest producer of oil, and our economy is 
significantly less oil intensive  than in the 1970s .  Today a rise in oil prices has mixed 
effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but  raising  
investment i n drilling over time and benefiting oil -producing areas more generally.  On 
net, oil shocks tend to weigh on output in the U.S. economy, but  by far less than in the 
1970s.   
Second, how likely is it that monetary policy can lower i nflation without c ausing a 
recession?   Our goal is to restore price stability while fostering another long expansion 
and sustaining a strong labor market .  In the  FOMC participant  projections  I just 
described, the economy achieves a soft landing, with inflation coming down and 
unemployment holding steady.  Growth slows as the very fast growth from the early 
 
4 I discussed this topic more fu lly in Jerome H. Powell (2019), “Data -Dependent Monetary Policy in an 
Evolving Economy,” speech delivered at “Trucks and Terabytes:  Integrating the ‘Old’ and ‘New’ 
Economies,” 61st Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Denver,  Colo., 
October 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm .  - 8 - 
 
stages of reopening fades, the effects of fiscal support wane, and monetary policy 
accommodation is removed.  
Some have argued that  history s tacks the odds against achieving a soft landing, 
and point to the 1994 episode as the  only successful soft landing in the postwar period .  I 
believe that the historical record provides some  grounds  for optimism :  Soft, or at least 
soft-ish, landings have b een relatively common in U.S. monetary  history.5  In three 
episodes —in 1965, 1984, and 1994—the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly  in 
response to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6  In other 
cases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the recessions w ere not apparently due to excessive tightening  of monetary policy .  For 
example, the tightening from 2015 to 2019 was followed by the pandemic -induced 
recession.
7 
I hasten to add that no one expect s that bringing about a soft landing will be 
straightforward in the current context —very little is straightforward in  the current 
context .  And monetary policy is often said to be a blunt instrument, not capable of 
surgical precision.  My colleagues and I will do our very best to succeed in this challenging task.  It is worth noting that t oday t he economy is very strong and is well 
positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.   
 
5 See Alan Blinder (2022), “Landings Hard and Soft:  The Fed, 1965 –2020,” slides f rom a presentation 
delivered at Markus’ Academy, Bendheim Center for Finance, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., 
February 11, https://bcf.princeton.edu/wp- content/ uploads/2022/01/Combined -Slides.pdf .   
6 I have identified these episodes by a single important year in the tightening cycle, but in each case , the 
period of tightening spanned more than one year.  
7 As I argued  more fully  in a pr evious speech , while the postwar recessions up through 1981 were arguably 
the result of stop -and-go policy, none of the recessions since then fit that mold so clearly ; see Jerome H. 
Powell (2018), “Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,” speech delivered at “Changing Market 
Struct ure and Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 24, https://www.federalrese rve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm .    - 9 - 
 
Finally, w hat will it take to restore price stability ?  The ultimate responsibility for 
price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.  Price stability is essential if we are going to 
have another sustained period of strong labor market conditions.  I believe that the policy 
approach that I have laid out  is well  suited to achieving this outcome .  We will take the 
necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability.  In particular, if we co nclude that it is 
appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so.  And if we determine that we need to 
tighten beyond common measures of neutral  and into a more r estrictive stance, we will 
do that as well.     
  Our monetary policy framework, as embodied in our S tatement o n Longer -Run 
Goals and Monetary P olicy S trategy , emphasizes that having longer -term inflation 
expectations anchored at our longer -run objective of 2 percent helps us achieve both our 
dual-mandate objectives.  While we cannot measure longer -term expectations directly, 
we monitor a variety of survey - and market- based indicators.  In the recent period, short -
term inflation expectations have, of course, risen with inflation , but l onger -run 
expectations  remain well  anchored in their historical ranges (figure 7).   
The added near -term upward pressure from the  invasion of  Ukraine on inflation 
from energy, food, and other commodities comes at a time of already too high inflation .  
In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary 
policy would look through a brief burst of inflat ion associated with commodity price 
shocks.  However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer -term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the 
Committee to move expeditiously as I have descri bed. - 10 - 
Conclusion   
The past t wo ye ars have be en extraordinarily challenging for many Americans.  
Two years ago, more than 20 million people were losing their jobs , millions w ere fa lling 
ill, and lives were being disrupted.  We have made enormous strides since then .  Today, 
as I have discussed, the labor market is very strong.  But, to end w here I began, i nflation 
is much too high.  We have the necessary  tools, and we will use them to restore price 
stability.
